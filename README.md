Automatic Hot Drinks Vending Machine

- It's a machine that serves caffeinated beverages with the touch screen (DWIN 7in DMT80480C070- 15WT) and the coin acceptor (DG600F) using Arduino Mega2560.

- This repo contains:
  1. Arduino code for the whole machine and its mechanisms (DC motors, stepper motor, pumps, valves, boiler & sensors).
  2. Design of smart UI/UX for the landing pages and programming of the DWIN touch screen using DGUS_SDK_V3.4 Software.
